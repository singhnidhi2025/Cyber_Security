# H2 Scene
## a)Podcast: 
I picked up an episode from Darknet Diaries , Ep. 138. **THE MIMICS OF PUNJAB**, since it was related to india and i was curious to find more about it.
Here is the summary from it:

- It talks about scams done my impersonating people and taking advantage of the emotional connection of relatives by looting them. They setup a scene of emergency ad distress of people living away from
 their home country and exert money from the relatives in the name of help.
- AI is also being used to aid these scams by imeprsonating teh voices of people and calling the relatives.
- Warning signs to look for: Don't tell anyone, Are you alone, Send the money immediately, etc.
- Exceptionally, when researching into the potential causes, the relatives can also be involved in sharing the data about the people being scammed in lieu of getting a share into the scammed money.
- Finally, the importance of Digital Privacy(how to protect our own data).
- Anyone and everyone can be a target iresspective of the age,place ,economic profile.
- Be mindful of your choices when selecting your service providers in digital life.
- If data privacy is a myth, governments and big corps refusing/failing to providing privacy, what are the options for a common man to protect themselves?
## b)Blog:
I picked up the article: **Alleged Jabber Zeus Coder ‘MrICQ’ in U.S. Custody** from **KrebsOnSecurity** just out of curiousity to see how it goes.
Here are the bullet points from it:

- The culprit **Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov**,was accussed of running a hacking group whch stole tens of millions of dollars from small and mid-sized business firms, when the accessed their online banking services.
- After entering into the victim company's account, they would add dozens of **money mules** to the company's payroll, who would then forward the stolen money to other mules in ukrain and the UK.
- This group wasn’t just stealing passwords—they intercepted one-time codes, rewrote browser pages, and even routed traffic through victim computers to look legitimate.
- The group was tracked down with the help of **myNetWatchman** , a threat intelligence company who gained access to the Chat server used by the hackers.
- Cybercrime investigations take years:Even though the crimes happened more than a decade ago, authorities continued tracking suspects. Cybercriminals shouldn’t expect time to erase evidence.
- The fact that they bypassed OTPs shows why MFA alone isn’t enough; banks need behavior-based detection and anomaly monitoring.
## c) Science that:
The H1 article *“Do cybersecurity threats and risks have an impact on the adoption of digital banking?”* highlights how **trust is critical** to the growth of digital banking. When threats like malware, fraud, and phishing are visible, user confidence drops; when strong defenses and enforcement are visible, adoption rises.

This idea connects directly to:

- **Darknet Diaries (ZeuS episode)** — real stories of banking malware stealing credentials and draining accounts
- **Krebs article on Jabber Zeus arrest** — law enforcement catching actors behind advanced financial malware

Together, they demonstrate:

- Cyber threats harm public trust in digital banking
- Sophisticated scams and malware undermine confidence in financial systems
- Visible law-enforcement action helps restore trust
- Cybersecurity is both technical and social — involving users, technology, and legal systems


## Reflection & Conclusion

What stood out is how deeply **trust** drives digital banking adoption. The research showed that fear of fraud affects whether people use online banking tools. The ZeuS story from Darknet Diaries made that risk feel very real — organized global cybercrime targeting ordinary users. Finally, the recent arrest of a key Zeus actor shows how restoring trust requires **long-term law-enforcement effort**.

Overall, digital banking success depends not just on technology, but on **security, accountability, and public confidence** working together.
